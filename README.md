We collected data from various websites, including sports-reference(https://www.sports-reference.com/) covering 3652 games played by 98 teams throughout the season. The data that we focused on included aspects such as matchday, team name, opposing team, team formation, opponent formation, match result, home/away status, GF, GA, and team rank.
