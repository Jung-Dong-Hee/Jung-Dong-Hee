# Data-driven understanding on soccer team tactics and ranking trends: Elo rating-based trends on European soccer leagues

## Abstract
In modern soccer, strategy and tactics significantly impact team success. In this study, the application of these technologies within the domain of association soccer is examined, with a particular focus on predicting team strategies via team trend analysis. Using a dataset comprising matches from the top five European soccer leagues, we analyze team performance trends over time using the Elo rating system and rolling regression. The prediction of strategies from soccer match datasets challenges. In our study, we propose methods based on count and rank to address these challenges. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our proposed methods to accurately identify and predict team strategies, offering significant implications for tactical decision-making in professional soccer. The findings indicate that the accuracy of predicting defensive strategies using count-based predictions was approximately 85\%, while the performance of predicting aggressive strategies through rank-based predictions was 89\%. Our methodology can be extended to the development of a predictive model aimed at forecasting team strategies, thereby assisting coaches with more effective preparation for upcoming matches.

## Soccer Data.xlsx
We collected data from various websites, including sports-reference(https://www.sports-reference.com/) covering 3652 games played by 98 teams throughout the season. The data that we focused on included aspects such as matchday, team name, opposing team, team formation, opponent formation, match result, home/away status, GF, GA, and team rank. Furthermore, to add depth to our analysis, we also used worldfootball(https://www.worldfootball.net/)to obtain real-time team rankings after each matchday.
